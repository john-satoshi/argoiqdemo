# Liquid Glass Design Standard

As of 2026-02-25, this project uses the visual language from:
- https://github.com/Muggleee/liquid-glass

## Default Rule
- Treat `Muggleee/liquid-glass` as the default reference for liquid glass behavior and aesthetics.
- For new UI work, prefer matching its shader feel: refraction-first glass, clean highlights, restrained tint, and physically plausible blur.
- Avoid introducing a competing glass style unless explicitly requested.

## Local Canonical Implementation
- Use `/Users/john/Documents/Codex | ArgoIQ Demoware/liquid-glass-studio` as the local baseline implementation when porting/adapting effects.

## Scope
- Applies to root prototypes and the SMB demo in this workspace.
